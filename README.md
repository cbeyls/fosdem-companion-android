# FOSDEM Companion

Advanced native Android schedule browser application for the [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/) conference in Brussels, Belgium.

This is a new implementation of the [legacy FOSDEM app](https://github.com/rkallensee/fosdem-android/). The code has been rewritten from scratch and the features have been extended. It is built on top of the latest [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) libraries by Google.
